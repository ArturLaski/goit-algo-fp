# Final Project

## Overview

This project includes implementations of various data structures and algorithms, ranging from basic linked list manipulations to complex graph algorithms and visualizations. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file as described below.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Data Structures. Sorting. Working with a Singly Linked List
- `task1.py`: Implements functions to reverse a singly linked list, sort a singly linked list, and merge two sorted singly linked lists.

### Task 2: Recursion. Creating the "Pythagorean Tree" Fractal
- `task2.py`: Uses recursion to create and visualize the "Pythagorean Tree" fractal.

### Task 3: Trees, Dijkstra's Algorithm
- `task3.py`: Develops Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph using a binary heap.

### Task 4: Visualization of the Heap
- `task4.py`: Constructs and visualizes binary trees, including a binary heap.

### Task 5: Visualization of Binary Tree Traversal
- `task5.py`: Visualizes in-depth and breadth-first traversal of binary trees using different colors for nodes.

### Task 6: Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming
- `task6.py`: Implements a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm to select dishes maximizing calories within a budget.

### Task 7: Using the Monte Carlo Method
- `task7.py`: Simulates a large number of dice rolls and calculates the probability of each possible sum using the Monte Carlo method.

## Conclusions

### Task 7: Using the Monte Carlo Method
The results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations for dice rolls closely match the theoretical probabilities. This confirms the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method for estimating probabilities in random processes. The results demonstrate the reliability and usefulness of simulation techniques in probabilistic computations.
